# Intro-to-Defensive-Security-Project

## Cybersecurity Bootcamp Team Project

**Project Purpose**:
This project tests students' ability to read, analyze, and understand Splunk logs in a given scenario.
<br>
<br>

### Project Scenario 

Your team will play the role of SOC analysts at a small company called Virtual Space Industries (VSI), which designs virtual-reality programs for businesses.
VSI has heard rumors that a competitor, JobeCorp, may launch cyberattacks to disrupt VSI’s business. As SOC analysts, you are tasked with using Splunk to monitor potential attacks on your systems and applications.

The VSI products that you have been tasked with monitoring include:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <li>An Apache web server, which hosts the administrative webpage</li>
  <li>A Windows operating system, which runs many of VSI’s back-end operations</li>
</ul>

Your networking team has provided given you past logs to help you develop baselines and create reports, alerts, dashboards, and more.
You’ve been provided the following logs on your machine:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <li>Windows Server Logs</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>This server contains intellectual property of VSI’s next-generation virtual-reality programs.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <li>Apache Server Logs</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li>This server is used for VSI’s main public-facing website, vsi-company.com.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<br>
<br>

**Project Goals**: Work with your team to analyze the Splunk logs and answer the questionnaire. Then - using visualizations your team has put together - be prepared to present your findings to the class.
